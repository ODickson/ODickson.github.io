										<p align="justify">I am a data scientist/bioinformatician currently working as a clinical data scientist at a health AI 
											startup pursuing the development of end to end pipelines to extract AI-driven clinical insights to 
											benefit the health of end-users. I am currently leading the development of a sleep score, a diabetes 
											management system, and biomarker engineering at the startup.
											
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											So far, professionally, I have worked on a UTI detection algorithm and led the end to end development 
											of a sleep score that is currently undergoing clinical validation in an academic trial. I have also 
											performed several data engineering and system architecture roles as we migrate platforms.
										</p>
										<p align="justify">
											It is my dream to develop large scale AI-based solutions to have lasting positive effects on people's 
											day-to-day quality of life in clinical or biological settings.
