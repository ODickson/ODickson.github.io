										An overview of my MSc thesis: "<em style="font-style: italic;">In silico</em> characterisation and classification of 
											B-cell maturation to aid precision medicine in aggressive lymphoma" for which I was awarded a distinction. I used 
											Linux high performance cloud computing to preprocess RNA and ATAC-seq data from 312 hours of B-cell maturation before
											conducting time series differential gene expression. Dimentiality reduction revealed three distinct clusters related to 
											the start, mid and late maturation phases of B-cell maturation. Using this, I created an ensemble machine learning
											classifier and tested it on over 5,000 patient lymphona samples. To read more click the link above.

										An overview of my BSc Disseratation: "A Database of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines". The lab I was attached to
										for my third year needed a centralised store of information on B-cell lymphoma cell lines, that had been custom annotated by 
										provided machine learning classifiers to aid their reaserch. They also required any database implemented to be accesseble by 
										non-coding research scientists. I set about implementing my solution in three main phases: 1. Understand what data needs to be gathered
										and the storage requirements. 2. Gather and clean the data and run machine learning classifiers and store in an SQL database. And 3.
										Implement a GUI to enable easy access for the lab based scientists. To read more click the link above.
