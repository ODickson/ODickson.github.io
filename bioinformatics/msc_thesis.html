									<p style="font-size:1.25em">
										Aggressive lymphomas are the sixth most common cancer type in the UK and form a poor prognosis group, with 10-year survival rates lower than 30% 
										with only 4% of cases thought to be preventable. These statistics make the need for better, more targeted treatments unequivocal. 
										The B-cell lymphoma umbrella covers a wide range of malignancies with huge variations attributable to the specific stage of B-cell maturation. These 
										malignancies can often be further subclassified based on the genetic abnormalities present in each tumour. Researchers have leveraged this information 
										to create and provide targeted treatments, enabling significant increases in progression-free survival rates. The future of treatment now lies in developing 
										novel therapeutics using accurate cell line models of each cancer type. 
										<br><br>
										This analysis provides a shortcut, circumventing the time and money needed to develop new cell lines by generating a classifier that can assign B-cell 
										maturation stages to existing cell lines. Time-series differential gene expression of 312 hours of B-cell maturation identified 25 essential genes. 
										Cluster analysis of 65 cell lines from eight types of B-cell lymphomas, using these 25 genes, identified three major time points of B-cell maturation. 
										Training of the ensemble classifier used the 25 genes and major time points, which lead to a reported accuracy of 0.989. Finally, 3,049 B-cell lymphoma patient 
										samples were classified into maturation time points, followed by correlation analysis to suggest each sample's most representative cell line.

										The primary aim was to analyse the B-cell maturation gene expression dataset generated by Coco et al. (2012) to identify the genes most associated with B-cell 
										maturation. Coco et al.'s (2012) dataset covers 312 hours of B-cell maturation in the lymph node following the maturation of B-cells to plasma cells. The topmost 
										differently expressed genes were identified through time-series differential gene expression across the 312 hours of maturation, using the R package DESeq2. 
										Finally, gene ontology analysis using the R package TopGo and the String database was performed to identify any enriched pathways and networks associated with 
										B-cell maturation.
										<br><br>
										The secondary aim was to identify which preexisting cell lines were most similar to the separate maturation stages of the B-cell. Using Barretina et al.'s (2012) 934 
										human cancer cell line dataset, correlation analysis was carried out between the cell lines and maturation stages. The basis for this stage was Koch et al.'s (2018) 
										conclusion that a correlation coefficient above 0.9 between two cells likely means the two samples belong to the same cell type, and thus each stage of maturation 
										that becomes malignant can be linked to a model cell line.
										<br><br>
										The final aim was the creation of an ensemble machine learning classifier that would predict the B-cell maturation stages of patient tumour samples. Dimensionality 
										reduction was performed on the maturation dataset to identify the presence of maturation related clusters. The ensemble classifier used Python 3's SciKit-Learn library. 
										It contained six base predictors: Logistic Regression, K Neighbours Classifier, Random Forest classifier, Support vector classifier, Na√Øve Bayes classifier and Multi-layer 
										Perceptron, the results of each will be combined by a logistic regression meta classifier. This method was chosen as a stacking ensemble classifier that produces more accurate 
										results than the individual models. As a final proof of concept, the classifier was then run on over 3,000 patient samples obtained from publicly available databases like 
										ArrayExpress, and the results were analysed.
