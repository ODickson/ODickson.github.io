									<p style="font-size:1.25em">
										Aggressive lymphomas are the sixth most common cancer type in the UK and form a poor prognosis group, with 10-year survival rates lower than 30% 
										with only 4% of cases thought to be preventable. These statistics make the need for better, more targeted treatments unequivocal. 
										The B-cell lymphoma umbrella covers a wide range of malignancies with huge variations attributable to the specific stage of B-cell maturation. These 
										malignancies can often be further subclassified based on the genetic abnormalities present in each tumour. Researchers have leveraged this information 
										to create and provide targeted treatments, enabling significant increases in progression-free survival rates. The future of treatment now lies in developing 
										novel therapeutics using accurate cell line models of each cancer type. 
										<br><br>
										This analysis provides a shortcut, circumventing the time and money needed to develop new cell lines by generating a classifier that can assign B-cell 
										maturation stages to existing cell lines. Time-series differential gene expression of 312 hours of B-cell maturation identified 25 essential genes. 
										Cluster analysis of 65 cell lines from eight types of B-cell lymphomas, using these 25 genes, identified three major time points of B-cell maturation. 
										Training the ensemble classifier used the 25 genes and major time points, leading to a reported accuracy of 0.989. Finally, 3,049 B-cell lymphoma patient 
										samples were classified into maturation time points, followed by correlation analysis to suggest each sample's most representative cell line.
